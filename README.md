# My_streamlit_frontend

Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.

All in pure Python. Often times in our data science job or even in cool side projects that we dedicate our time and energy to,
we face the dilemma of showcasing our work properly. We want to make sure our model works as an API, we try to put it all together
as a package and expect someone else to run and interact with it in the same way we did.

Streamlit is the solution :)  Thanks, MÄ±sra Turp for the amazing tutorial.
